        <h2> About me </h2>
          <div class="box-center">
        <p> I am a new Software Developer located in Denver, CO. I am passionate about Software Development because I enjoy building code from scratch into something useful. I also enjoy the problem-solving that comes with coding challenges.</p>
        <p> I am looking for an employer who values: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Loyalty </li>
          <li> Attention to detail </li>
          <li> High adaptability</li>
        </ul>
        <p> In my free time I enjoy the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Cooking with my family</li>
          <li> Indoor rock climbing</li>
          <li> Photography </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Thank you for taking the time to visit my webpage! I come from a technical background that includes professional work in Audio Engineering, higher education, and emergency services as an EMT and Volunteer Firefighter. I am heavily relied on to support group dynamics and build confident, efficient teams. </p>
        <p> I am currently enrolled part-time at Metropolitan State University of Denver studying for my undergrad in Computer Science. Recently, I have also enrolled in a coding boot camp at Thinkful which I hope to finish by August 2022. Upon completion, my goal is to apply my technical background to software development, where I feel that I can affect a positive role in the way consumers use online web services. </p>
        <p> I am happy to discuss whatever projects you think I could contribute to. Thanks again for your time.</p>
